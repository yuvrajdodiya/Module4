//3. What is the difference between OOP and POP?
OOP:-Object Oriented Programing
1)OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.
2)the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure.
3)It ties data more closely to the function that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from outside function.
4)OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and function around these objects.
5)The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated with that object. However, 
function of one object can access the function of other objects.


POP:-Procedural Oriented Programing
1)In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
2) a program is written as a sequence of procedures or function.
3) each procedure contains a series of instructions for performing a specific task.
4)During the program execution each procedure can be called by the other procedures.
5)To call a procedure, we have to write function name only.
